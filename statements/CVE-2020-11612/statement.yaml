vulnerability_id: CVE-2020-11612
notes:
- text: The ZlibDecoders in Netty 4.1.x before 4.1.46 allow for unbounded memory allocation while decoding a ZlibEncoded byte stream. An attacker could send a large ZlibEncoded byte stream to the Netty server, forcing the server to allocate all of its free memory to a single decoder.
