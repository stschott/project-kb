vulnerability_id: CVE-2020-5404
notes:
- text: The HttpClient from Reactor Netty, versions 0.9.x prior to 0.9.5, and versions 0.8.x prior to 0.8.16, may be used incorrectly, leading to a credentials leak during a redirect to a different domain. In order for this to happen, the HttpClient must have been explicitly configured to follow redirects.
